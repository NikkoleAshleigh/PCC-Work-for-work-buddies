# Create Your First Github Repository


1. Login to Github

2. Click the green "New" or "New Repository" button

3. Name your repository "myfirstrepo", select initialize  with a README.md file, and click "Create Repository"

4. On your new repository's page, copy the link that looks like this:

https://github.com/yourusername/myfirstrepo.git

5. In your terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows) type the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myfirstrepo.git

6. After it finishes cloning, to open the folder we cloned this folder into type the following commands:

Mac: open .

Windows: start .

7. Open a new window in VS Code and drag that folder into it.

8. Edit the README.md file, just type anything into it and save it. Now we have made changes that we can push to github.

9. Click on the version control tab on your sidebar in VS code. You should see a list of all the changes you have made to this folder.

10. Enter a commit message, click the check mark above that message box, and select yes for the popup asking you if you want to commit these changes.

11. Once your changes disappear from the list they have been staged.

12. Finally in the bottom left of VS code right next to where it says master or your branch name, there should be a cloud icon that if you hover over it, it will says publish these changes or something similar. Click that and follow any additional prompts github may require (github may ask you to login or enter your password, this should only happen the first time you do this).

13. After sync symbol is done spinning, you have successfully completed your first push to Github! Check your repository's page on Github to confirm.

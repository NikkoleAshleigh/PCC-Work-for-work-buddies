# Intro to Collaboration and Pull Requests

1. In groups of 3 or more, have one team member create a github repository and invite the other team members to be collaborators.

2. Create a markdown file with one line of text.

3. Have each team member make their own branch.

4. On each separate branch add some text to the file and then publish your branch.

5. In the Github repo create a pull request for our branch and resolve any merge conflicts.

6. Lastly merge each branch to the master and delete the old branches.
